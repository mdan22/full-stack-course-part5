# full-stack-course-part5

This includes both frontend, backend and tests of the blogs app for Part 5 submissions of the course

## A true full stack developer's oath

Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
- I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
- I will keep an eye on the database: does the backend save data there in the right format
- I progress with small steps
- when I suspect that there is a bug in the frontend, I'll make sure that the backend works as expected
- when I suspect that there is a bug in the backend, I'll make sure that the frontend works as expected
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code and the tests behave and to help pinpoint problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I'll start deleting it until it works or will just return to a state where everything was still working
- If a test does not pass, I'll make sure that the tested functionality works properly in the application
- When I ask for help in the course Discord channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info#how-to-ask-help-in-discord) how to ask for help
